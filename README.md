# FUNCTIONAL-DASHBOARD-USING-DASH

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a functional dashboard using Dash, a Python framework for building web applications with interactive visualizations. The dashboard allows users to explore and interact with data dynamically.

## Steps Involved

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
Ensure the following Python packages are installed:
```
pip install dash pandas plotly
```

### Step 2: Import Required Libraries
- `dash` for building the web application
- `dash_core_components` and `dash_html_components` for UI elements
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `plotly` for creating visualizations

### Step 3: Load and Process Data
- Read the dataset using Pandas
- Perform any necessary data cleaning and transformation

### Step 4: Define the Layout
- Design the layout using Dash components
- Include graphs, dropdowns, sliders, and other interactive elements

### Step 5: Add Callbacks for Interactivity
- Implement callback functions to update charts based on user input
- Connect dropdowns, sliders, and other UI elements to data updates

### Step 6: Run the App
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```

### Step 7: Deploying the Dashboard
- The dashboard can be deployed on platforms like Heroku or Render
- Export requirements using:
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
- Follow the deployment instructions for the selected platform

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Dash
- Pandas
- Plotly

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the script to launch the dashboard.
4. Access the dashboard in a web browser.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the creation of an interactive functional dashboard using Dash, providing users with a dynamic data exploration experience.
